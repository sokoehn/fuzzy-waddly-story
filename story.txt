Claire walked down the sidewalk, soaking in the sun, as she headed home after aa long day of class.
She just finished her computer science midterm and could not wait to go home and take a nap. She never thought she could be so exhuasted. It's her second year and she got more tired everyday. No matter how much she slept the night before. 

Claire arrived at home and went to sit down on her couch. Since she was so tired, she dozed off into a nap. Within her dream
she visioned her car was being broken into. It was a scary experience. After being startled from her dream, Claire woke up
and went to check on her actual car in the real world.

When she went into her parking garage, she found a small paper note in her cars stall. The note read "if you ever want to see your car again go to the abandond warehouse on the south 
side of town - AK" Claire made her way to the warehouse and upon entering, Ashton Kutcher jumped out telling her that she had been PUNKED. Claire's reaction was priceless.
