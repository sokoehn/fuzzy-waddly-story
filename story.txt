Claire walked down the sidewalk, soaking in the sun, as she headed home after aa long day of class.
She just finished her computer science midterm and could not wait to go home and take a nap. She never thought she could be so exhuasted. It's her second year and she got more tired everyday. No matter how much she slept the night before. 

Claire arrived at home and went to sit down on her couch. Since she was so tired, she dozed off into a nap. Within her dream
she visioned her car was being broken into. It was a scary experience. After being startled from her dream, Claire woke up
and went to check on her actual car in the real world.

She went found her car door open and her backpack with her laptop missing. 
She had an upcoming project in her CS class saved on her laptop but she had not submitted it to canvas.
Claire was hearbroken, she sat down and cried on the hood of her car. 

Out of the corner of her blurry vision, she saw a small note. The note read "if you ever want to see your car again go to the abandond warehouse on the south 
side of town - AK" Claire made her way to the warehouse and upon entering, Ashton Kutcher jumped out telling her that she had been PUNKED. Claire's reaction was priceless.

Meeting Ashton Kutcher was the highlight of her  life. Claire couldn't be happier.
